# Week-Three Challenge

## Description

This weeks challenge was for us to use our knowledge on all things JavaScript to create a password generator that chooses a random password based on a set of criteria that the user inputs.

## Installation

Link to Website: https://aipuameh.github.io/Random-Password-Generator/

## Usage

To use this password generator, you click the red button labeled "Generate Password" and a series of 5 questions will pop up to the window asking what you would like your password to look like. After that, a string of the random password will print to the text box in place of the text "Your Secure Password."
